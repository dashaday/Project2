      <h2>Blurb About Me</h2>
      <p>I moved here from the Philippines about a year and a half ago. I was raised in the heart of the bustling city of Manila. I love the rush and accessibility and fun of the chaotic city but still love looking back to my hometown Samboan, Cebu. I love the ocean and I personally think it kind of sucks that I have to travel a bajillion miles from Chicago to go see some sea. I love musicals, lots of art (not too much of the classical kind), and food! I love milk tea/ boba and if you don't, then you haven't had a good one yet. I take really close attention to detail to the point that it will cost me a whole night's sleep. Random fact: I jumped a 15-foot cliff to the sea. Exhilirating!</p>

      <h2>Intro to Sis</h2>
      <p>My sister is named bob. Hahaha. It's not. I just call her that. I also call her Babadook. Like the horror monster. Cause she's a horror. She's turning 14, but I tell the cinema people that she's 12. Hehe. She says pho when she wants to say fuuu- or when she wants to eat pho. I also like pho. Pho! She broke her tailbone (she thinks so) She also made me read the last 100 pages of her reading assignment. Which she passed btw. I'm amazing. I put sticky note summaries on every other page. I'm the best. This is basically me telling you about my sister, and how great I am. I'm great. Sorry I wasted your time. lol.</p>
